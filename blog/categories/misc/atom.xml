    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The title pretty much says it all -- I'm finally launching a blog as I segue
into the graduate lifestyle and start <a href="http://umdphysics.umd.edu/">PhD School</a> in August.</p>

<p>I plan to post on a variety of topics (the only real criterion being things that
interests me), but posts will likely cluster around physics, education,
technology, and the occasional (software) hack. I also plan to write
<a href="http://blog.learnstream.org/2012/01/weekly-review-through-december-19/">weekly reviews</a>
to summarize and collect my thoughts on the week, however interesting or mundane they might be.</p>

<p>That's about it; stay tuned and check back. We'll see if I can actually keep this up.</p>
