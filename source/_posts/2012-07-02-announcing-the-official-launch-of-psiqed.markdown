The title pretty much says it all -- I'm finally launching a blog as I segue
into the graduate lifestyle and start [PhD School](http://umdphysics.umd.edu/) in August.

I plan to post on a variety of topics (the only real criterion being things that
interests me), but posts will likely cluster around physics, education, 
technology, and the occasional (software) hack. I also plan to write 
[weekly reviews](http://blog.learnstream.org/2012/01/weekly-review-through-december-19/) 
to summarize and collect my thoughts on the week, however interesting or mundane they might be.

That's about it; stay tuned and check back. We'll see if I can actually keep this up.
